synchronization:
----------------
*the process of matching the speed (or) wavelength is called as synchronization.
                        (or)
*the process of matching the speed of selenium with application is called as synchronization.
*selenium is very faster when compare to application.
*to synch selenium with application we use below types,
    *there are 4 types of synchronization,
    1.sleep()
    2.implicit wait
    3.explicit wait
    4.fluent wait

1.sleep():
==========
*it is a method which is used to pause/stop the execution for certain period of time.
*it wil wait until the specified time duration.

drawback:
---------
*if element is visible within less than specified time duration then it will wait complete specified time duration.
(because of these execution time will be more/waste if time)
*in a single webpage if we have 'n' element to be wait/sync then we should write 'n' times sleep(), bcz of this
code length will be increase and it is not a optimized code.

2.implicit wait():
------------------
*to over come the draw back of sleep() method we use implicit wait().
*it will sync only for find_element() and find_elements() methods.
*if the "element is visible" less than specified time duration then it will not wait the remaining specified time,
it will ignore the remaining time and it will continue the next line execution.
*in a single webpage if we have 'n' elements, single implicit wait will sync all the 'n' elements.
*if the "element is not visible" within the specified time duration then it will raise "NoSuchElement Exception".
