*a DD a is collection/list of options.
*DD are classifed into 2 types,
1.standard DD
2.Non-Standard DD

1.standard DD:
**************
*any DD developed by "select tag" is called as standard DD.
*standard DD is classified into 2 types,
1.single select drop down(SSDD)
2.multi select drop down(MSDD)
*to automate DD we use "Select" class.
*select class constructor will accept one argument that is address if drop-down in web-page.
class Select:
    def __init__(self, webelement):
        ...    

s = Select(dropdown_ele)

1.single select drop down(SSDD):
********************************
*in SSDD we can select only one option and we can't select multiple option and we can't de-select the option.

2.multi select drop down(MSDD)
********************************
*in MSDD we can select we can select multiple option and we can de-select the option.

*to select an options we have 3 methods,
1.select_by_index()
    *index starts from 0
2.select_by_value()
    *in html code it should consisting of "value" as an attribute and we need to pass attribute value.
    (if we pass other attribute value it will not work)
3.select_by_visible_text()
    *we need to pass option text value and it is a case-senscetive.

*to de-select an option we have 4 methods,
1.deselect_by_index()
2.deselect_by_value()
3.deselect_by_visible_text()
4.deselect_all()
    *it will deselect all the options.
