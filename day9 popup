******************************************
*this popup is classified into 2 types.
1.simple alert     
    *this popup will consist of single option either "ok"/"cancel".
2.alert and confirmation
    *this popup will consist of both "ok" and "cancel" option.

*to handle this popup we should switch control from webpage to alert by following method,
    a = driver.switch_to.alert
*to click on "ok" button we use "accept()" method, to click on "cancel" button we use "dismiss()" method.
*only for "simple alert" we can use both methods.
*for "alert and confirmation" for ok use accept() and for cancel use dismiss().
*if we perform both "accept() and dismiss()" method then it will throw 
        "NoAlertPresentException: Message: no such alert"
*we can't perform any action on webpage until we handle the popup.
*to get the text of alert we use ".text" property.

characteristic:
---------------
*we can't drag/move the popup.
*we can't inspect the popup.
